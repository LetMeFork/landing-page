# Landing Page
My implementation of the [Landing Page Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
According to the assignment, the page should look like [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png). Fonts and colors for it are detailed [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png).

The project is for beginners and the design is provided as a simple image. So I got my implementation quite close to what was assigned, but it's not pixel-perfect. The point of the project is **creating something from scratch and put various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest**.

I've also implemented some responsiveness: the page with its content shrinks quite nicely if the browser window gets narrower. This was not required by the assignment, but it's good to have anyway.
